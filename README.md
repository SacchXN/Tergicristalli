### How to use
The command **%load** allows you to load the logs you want to analyze.\
Example: %load https://www.fflogs.com/reports/0123456789abcdef/,https://www.fflogs.com/reports/abcdef0123456789/ \
Once the bot replies with "*Logs url(s) have been read.*" you can now select what fight you want to analyze using **%encounter**. Unless you want to change fight to analyze you don't have to set this value everytime since it is stored by the bot.\
Example: %encounter dsr \
You can choose between **ucob**, **uwu**, **tea** and **dsr**. It is now possible to decide what chart you want to create.
